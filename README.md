# RDR2-Combat-Experience
This mod aims to enhance the combat experience in the game, with several configurable additions.

### Installation:
- Download and install AB's ScripthookRDR2: http://www.dev-c.com/rdr2/scripthookrdr2/
- Make sure you have an asi loader, it usually comes along with Scripthook.
- Copy *CombatExperience.asi* and *CombatExperience.ini* files to the game's root folder.

### Features overview
NOTE: All features can be turned off through the .ini file.
- The camera can now be zoomed while aiming in third person. 
  Use the mouse wheel to zoom in / out if you're using keyboard and mouse, or the down arrow in your controller.
- Machete and cleaver will now cut off specific bodyparts upon hit (head / arms / legs).
- The camera slightly shakes upon shot, giving a more realistic sense to shooting.

### Known issues:
- Melee weapons gore isn't working when on dead NPCs. It does work when they're knocked out.
